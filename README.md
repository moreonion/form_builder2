## Usage

Plugins are loaded from the `moFormBuilder` global, whereby element templates are listed in the array `moFormBuilder.plugins.templates` and element types live in the dictionary `moFormBuilder.plugins.types`, keyed by their unique name.
Because we have to register the pluginsâ€™s components globally, the plugins have to be present before the Vue app is instanciated.
